            <p>Full Stack Web Development course with six weeks of foundational studies followed by a nine-week intensive bootcamp. By the end of the bootcamp, I was able to build applications and prototypes independently and as part of a team.</p>
            <p>Tech stack included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS
                </li>
                <li>
                    Javascript
                </li>
                <li>
                    React
                </li>
                <li>
                    Git
                </li>
                <li>
                    RESTful APIs
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As web development is often done in teams, a lot of emphasis was put on collaboration and interpersonal skills.
